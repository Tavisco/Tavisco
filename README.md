### Hey!

I'm someone who likes to write code and mess with old hardware

I mostly write **Kotlin/Java** for backend at work, and **C** for personal projects these days.

Also, here are a some of **my repositories** that are worth mentioning:

- [Palmkedex](https://github.com/Tavisco/Palmkedex) - A complete Pok√©dex for Palm OS PDAs! Written primarily in C!
- [Student Organizer](https://github.com/Tavisco/StudentOrganizer) - The recreation in C of a simple program I wrote for Palm OS when I was 13 years old using a BASIC compiler that generated binaries for the PDAs. This recreation project was my first ever contact with the C language.

I sometimes write [blog](https://tavisco.dev) posts as well.
