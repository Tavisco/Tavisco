### Hey!

I'm someone who likes to **write code**, and **mess with old hardware**.

Ever since I joined GitHub **9** years ago, I pushed **936** commits, opened **8** issues, submitted **15** pull requests and received **19** stars across **22** personal projects.

I mostly write **Kotlin/Java** for backend at work, and **C** for personal projects these days.

Also, here are a some of **my repositories** that are worth mentioning:

- [Palmkedex](https://github.com/Tavisco/Palmkedex) - A complete Pok√©dex for Palm OS PDAs! Written completely in C, with bits of Python for the scraper script!
- [Student Organizer](https://github.com/Tavisco/StudentOrganizer) - The recreation in C of a simple program I wrote for Palm OS when I was 13 years old using a BASIC compiler that generated binaries for the PDAs. This project was my first contact ever with the C language.

I sometimes write [blog](https://tavisco.dev) posts as well.
